## Startups
### Some might think is difficult for startups to compete with big corporations or already established businesses. This might be the case for enterprise business models but small emerging tech/business sectors is where startups/independent teams excel in comparison by the following points:
- Established corps are serving multiple large market segments, they cant fully optimize for new specific business.  
- Established corps have dependencies: regulations, guidelines, permissions, authorization, old tech and standards. 
- Based on above points they can't fully optimize for new emerging business.  
- Is easier for new teams/startups to think revolutionary and progressive, without constraints, authoruzations,etc...
- Breaking changes: a new team/business have less dependencies: regulations, old standards/technologies/methods/tools/stack.
