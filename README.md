## Startups
#### Some might think is difficult for startups to compete with big corporations or well established businesses. This might be the case for enterprise business models but  a new business sectors or emerging/evolving technologies are where startups excel in comparison by the following reasons:
▪ Big Corporations are serving multiple large market segments, they can't update/optimize for new specific business.  
▪ Established corps have dependencies: regulations, paperworks, permissions, authorization, old tech and standards.  
▪ Based on above points they can't fully optimize for new emerging business.

▪ Breaking changes: a new team has less dependencies vs a team depending on a mother company following their:  
.- rules, regulations, methods and old standards/technologies/tools/stack.
