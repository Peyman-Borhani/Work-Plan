## Startups
#### Some might think is difficult for startups to compete with big corporations or already established businesses. This might be the case for enterprise business models but small emerging tech/business sectors is where startups/independent teams excel in comparison by the following reasons:
▪ Big Corporations are serving multiple large market segments, they can't update/optimize for new specific business.  
▪ Established corps have dependencies: regulations, paperworks, permissions, authorization, old tech and standards.  
▪ Based on above points they can't fully optimize for new emerging business.  
▪ Is easier for new teams/startups to think revolutionary and progressive, without constraints, authorizations,etc...  
▪ Breaking changes: a new team/business have less dependencies: regulations, old standards/technologies/methods/tools/stack.
